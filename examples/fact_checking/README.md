## White-box attacks with `llmart`

The attacks run end-to-end adversarial optimization on the fact-checking task used by the MiniCheck framework.

MiniCheck paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10774 \
MiniCheck repository: https://github.com/Liyan06/MiniCheck

Given a claim and a document, appending adversarial suffixes for either can be run using the commands:
```
python document.py
python claim.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Because the scripts will verify the optimized suffix using the reference `vllm` pipeline, these examples require at least two GPUs (or a single GPU with at least 80 GB of VRAM).

In both cases, the goal is to adversarially make a claim unrelated to the document to be evaluated as factual and in-context for the document.

The two examples differ in how and where adversarial tokens are optimized:
- In `document.py` we use the **token replacement** functionality. In this case, all occurences of tokens that decode to `"sprawling canopy"` are automatically found and replaced with a number of `attack_budget` adversarial tokens (configurable through the command line and defaulting to 8):

- In `claim.py` we use the **adversarial suffix** functionality, which appends additional tokens at the end of the input claim:
